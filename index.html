          Jason Statham (born 26 July 1967) is an English actor. Typecast as the
          antihero, he is known for his action-thriller roles and portraying
          tough, irredeemable, and machiavellian characters. Born in Shirebrook,
          Derbyshire, he began practising Chinese martial arts, kickboxing, and
          karate recreationally in his youth while working at local market
          stalls. An avid footballer and diver, he was a member of Britain's
          national diving team, competing for England in the 1990 Commonwealth
          Games. Shortly after, he was asked to model for French Connection,
          Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi's in various advertising campaigns. Statham's
          past professional history working in market stalls inspired his
          casting in the Guy Ritchie crime films Lock,
