          Wild Card is a 2015 American action thriller film directed by Simon
          West and starring Jason Statham, Michael Angarano, Dominik
          Garcia-Lorido, Milo Ventimiglia, Hope Davis, and Stanley Tucci. The
          film is based on the 1985 novel Heat by William Goldman, and is a
          remake of the 1986 adaptation that starred Burt Reynolds.[4] The film
          was released in the United States on January 30, 2015 in a limited
          release and through video on demand. Wild Card received negative
          reviews and was a box-office bomb, making only $6.7 million worldwide
          against a $30 million budget. Plot Nick Wild (Jason Statham) is a
          recovering gambling addict who takes odd jobs in Las Vegas as a
          "chaperone" (his version of a bodyguard) to support his addiction.
          After helping a client impress a woman (Sofía Vergara), he accepts a
          proposition from a young man, Cyrus Kinnick (Michael Angarano), to
          show him around Vegas and provide him with protection while he
          gambles. While eating at a diner, Nick's waitress friend Roxy (Anne
          Heche) hands him a message from a woman he knows, Holly (Dominik
          Garcia-Lorido), who wants him to stop by her house. Holly, a
          professional escort, explains she had a date the previous night at the
          Golden Nugget. Afterward, she was brutally raped and beaten by three
          unknown men in their hotel room. Holly asks Nick to find out who they
          are so that she can sue them. Nick discovers that the man responsible
          for raping Holly is Danny DeMarco (Milo Ventimiglia), a gangster.
          DeMarco had his two thugs dump her in a hospital car park. Nick goes
          to the hotel to confront DeMarco, disguised as someone sent by another
          criminal. A confrontation develops but Nick defends himself,
          overpowering DeMarco and his men, who are tied up as Nick calls Holly.
          In the room, Holly contemplates castrating DeMarco, who breaks down
          and begs her forgiveness, Holly decides to take the $50,000 from
          DeMarco's desk and leaves. Holly splits the money with Nick and leaves
          Las Vegas. Nick takes Cyrus to a casino. Playing blackjack with dealer
          friend Cassandra (Hope Davis), Nick then goes on a huge winning streak
          with the next dealer, amassing over a half a million. But when he goes
          to the cashier, he has a sudden anxiety attack, then decides to keep
          on gambling and unfortunately loses his winnings – as well as his
          original $25,000 – on a single blackjack bet with Cassandra. The next
          morning, Cyrus, revealed to be a self-made millionaire, wants Nick to
          mentor him on being brave, but Nick declines. At the bar, DeMarco's
          men arrive to deliver Nick to DeMarco, but Nick fends them off. Nick
          meets with Baby (Stanley Tucci), the mafia boss of Las Vegas. Baby has
          received a complaint from DeMarco, who claims that Nick broke into his
          hotel room, pistol-whipped him, and killed two of his men – all to
          fund his gambling addiction. Baby takes Nick to a room with DeMarco,
          where Nick tells his side of the story: that DeMarco killed his own
          men later and that DeMarco bears a cut on his penis. Baby tells
          DeMarco to drop his pants to prove Nick wrong, but he refuses and
          leaves. At the local diner, Cyrus offers Nick a check for $500,000 and
          a plane ticket to Corsica for what he has learned from Nick. DeMarco
          and his men appear in the diner. Cyrus shows his newfound manliness by
          singing loudly as a distraction so Nick can escape. Nick thinks about
          his sailboat and then kills the thugs and DeMarco with his utensils
          behind the diner. Afterwards, Cyrus insists Nick take the check and
          the ticket, and Nick accepts. Nick then drives out of Las Vegas.
