          Furious 7 (also known as Fast & Furious 7), is a 2015 American action
          film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the
          sequel to Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and the seventh installment in the
          Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker,
          Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris "Ludacris"
          Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason
          Statham. In the film, Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner, and the rest of
          their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal
          lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes, until Deckard
          Shaw, a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose
          younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. This was Paul
          Walker's final film appearance following his death on November 30,
          2013.[5] Plans for a seventh installment were first announced in
          February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would
          begin after the completion of Fast & Furious 6. In April 2013, Wan,
          predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the
          film. Casting began showing the returns of Diesel and Walker that same
          month. Principal photography began that September in Atlanta, but was
          indefinitely suspended in November after Walker's death; filming
          resumed in April 2014 and ended in July, with Walkers's brothers Caleb
          and Cody standing-in to complete his remaining scenes, causing delay
          to its 2015 release date; with other filming locations including Los
          Angeles, Colorado, Abu Dhabi, and Tokyo. With an estimated production
          budget of up to $250 million, it is one of the most expensive films
          ever made. Furious 7 premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015, and
          was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, exactly six
          years after the fourth film was released. Upon release, the film
          became a critical and financial success, with praise being aimed at
          the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. It
          grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which was
          the highest of all-time at the time. The film grossed over $1.5
          billion worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2015
          and the fourth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of
          release. Additionally, Furious 7 became the highest-grossing film of
          the franchise in the first twelve days of its theatrical release and
          is still the highest-grossing film in the franchise to date. A sequel,
          The Fate of the Furious, was released in April 2017.
