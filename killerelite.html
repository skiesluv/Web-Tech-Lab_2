          Killer Elite is a 2011 action thriller film starring Jason Statham,
          Clive Owen and Robert De Niro. The film is based on the 1991 novel The
          Feather Men by Sir Ranulph Fiennes and is directed by Gary McKendry.
          In 1980, mercenaries Danny Bryce (Jason Statham), Hunter (Robert De
          Niro), Davies (Dominic Purcell), and Meier (Aden Young) are in Mexico
          to assassinate a man. Danny is shot when he becomes distracted after
          realizing he has killed the man in front of the target's young child.
          Affected by this, Danny retires and returns to his native Australia.
          The following year, Danny is summoned to Oman to meet The Agent
          (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). He learns that Hunter failed a $6 million
          job. If Danny does not complete Hunter's mission, Hunter will be
          executed. Sheikh Amr, a deposed king of a small region of Oman, wants
          Danny to kill three former SAS troopers—Steven Harris (Lachy Hulme),
          Warwick Cregg (Grant Bowler), and Simon McCann (Daniel Roberts)—for
          killing his three eldest sons during the Dhofar Rebellion. Danny must
          videotape their confessions and make their deaths look like accidents,
          all before the terminally ill sheikh dies. This will allow the
          sheikh's fourth son, Bakhait (Firass Dirani), to regain control of his
          father's desert region. Davies and Meier agree to help Danny for a
          share of the money. Danny and Meier find Harris still living in Oman
          and gain access to his house pretending to be researchers making a
          documentary. After Harris confesses on videotape, they take him to the
          bathroom, intending to make it look like he slipped and hit his head.
          However, Harris's girlfriend knocks on the door. While Danny and Meier
          are distracted, Harris attempts to break free, causing Meier to shoot
          him. In England, Davies travels to a pub known to be frequented by
          British military personnel and questions bar patrons about former SAS
          members in Oman. This is reported to the Feather Men, a secret society
          of former operatives protecting their own. Their head enforcer, Spike
          Logan (Clive Owen), is sent to investigate. Davies discovers Cregg
          preparing for a long nighttime march in wintry weather on the Brecon
          Beacons mountain range. Danny infiltrates the base, disguised in
          uniform, and drugs Cregg's coffee. Danny follows Cregg on the march
          and makes him confess before the drug sends him into shock to die of
          hypothermia. Aware that the Feather Men are now following them, Danny
          decides to use a different tactic to kill their last target, Simon
          McCann, who is now working as a mercenary. Their plan is to set up a
          fake job interview to lure McCann out of his house and then to crash a
          remote-controlled truck into McCann's car. With the help of the
          inexperienced Jake (Michael Dorman), Meier kills McCann; however,
          Logan and his men were watching over McCann. A gunfight ensues, and
          Jake accidentally kills Meier. Danny and Davies part ways. Davies is
          tracked down by Logan's men, and is fatally hit by a truck while
          trying to escape. Danny returns to Oman and gives the sheikh the last
          confession, which he has faked. Hunter is released, while Danny heads
          back to Australia and reunites with Anne (Yvonne Strahovski), a
          childhood acquaintance. Soon, he is informed by the Agent that there
          is one last man who participated in the sheikh's sons' murders and
          that this man, Ranulph Fiennes, is about to release a book about his
          experiences in the SAS. Danny sends Anne to France so Hunter can
          protect her. The sheikh's son confirms that Harris was innocent.
          Logan, meanwhile, traces Danny through the Agent and sends a team to
          protect the author, but Jake distracts them, allowing Danny to shoot
          Fiennes. He only wounds the man, however, taking pictures that appear
          to show him dead. Logan captures Danny, taking him to an abandoned
          warehouse, but then a government agent arrives and reveals that the
          British government is behind the events because of the sheikh's
          valuable oil reserves. A three-way battle ensues, with Danny escaping
          and Logan shooting the government agent. In Paris, the Agent tries to
          kidnap Anne for ransom, but Hunter beats the henchman and shoots the
          Agent in the leg. Hunter seems threatening at first, but spares his
          life. Danny and Hunter head to Oman to give the sheikh the pictures.
          However, Logan arrives first, tells the sheikh the pictures are fake
          and then stabs him to death. The sheikh's son does not care; he gives
          Logan the money. Hunter spots Logan leaving, and they chase after him,
          along with the sheikh's men. After stopping the sheikh's men, Danny
          and Hunter confront Logan on a desert road. Hunter takes some of the
          money for his expenses and his family. They leave the remainder,
          telling Logan that he will need it to start a new life after killing
          the government agent and acting against the wishes of the Feather Men
          and the British government. Danny says that it is over for him and
          that Logan must make up his own mind what to do. Danny reunites with
          Anne.
